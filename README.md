# Super_Mario_Game
This is my COAL-Lab project (3rd semester). I made this game using assembly language in MASM615 using text mode.I implemented three levels, while incrementing the difficulty level, I also implemented an extra feature for this project of file handling to store names and scores of players in text file.
